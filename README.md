# MasonGuard - Python Obfuscator
---
Obfuscation: The library obfuscates the source code, making it difficult to read or understand. This is achieved by renaming variables and functions, as well as restructuring the code.
---
Anti-Debugging: The library can include anti-debugging techniques to prevent attackers from using debugging tools to analyze or trace the execution of the code.
---
Anti-Tamper: The library includes techniques to prevent tampering with the code or modifying it after obfuscation. This helps maintain the integrity of the code and prevent unauthorized changes.
